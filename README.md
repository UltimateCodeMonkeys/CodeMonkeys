CodeMonkeysMVVM is an MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) application development framework with focus on Xamarin.Forms.

It is built with .NET Standard and therefor supports nearly every environment.  
Currently it is entirely focused on Xamarin.Forms but maybe we will support WPF for example in the future.
